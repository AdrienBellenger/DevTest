# DevTest


The current version is version 7, released on February 4, 2016. It uses Zend Engine 2 and
introduces more efficient object modeling, error management based on the
exceptions model, as well as management features for businesses. PHP 5
brings a lot of novelties, such as SQLite support as well as ways to
manipulate libxml2-based XML files and structures:
 - a simple API named SimpleXML;
 - a fairly complete Document Object Model API;
 - an XPath interface that uses DOM and SimpleXML objects
integration of libxslt for XSLT transformations via the XSL extension;
 - a much better management of objects compared to PHP 4, with possibilities that
tend to be closer to those of Java.

The last update is 7.0.4 dated March 3, 2016.
